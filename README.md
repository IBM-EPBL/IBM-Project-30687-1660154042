Effective Analysis & Prediction of Water Quality Implementing machine learning Water is seen as a crucial resource that has an impact on many elements of human health and existence. People who live in metropolitan areas are often concerned about the quality of the water. The cornerstone for the prevention and management of waterborne infections is the quality of the water, which is a significant environmental influence. As a result, this project aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML) model to Predict Water Quality by taking into account all water quality standard indicators. However, this is a challenging task because the water quality in urban spaces varies non-linearly and depends on numerous factors, such as meteorology, water usage patterns, and land uses.
